# PS5-BAR-Reader
Some code for check your backup and restore data if you get CE-100511-8 error when restoring your PS5.

## Preambule
I'm backup my PS5, backup was been made successfully, but when i try to restore, have an issue CE-100511-8. Google and playstation.com didn't help.

I change Usb Format - that didn't help:
- `Fat32` ERROR
- `ExFat` ERROR
- `NTFS` PS5 can't read

I have trouble always on 21$ of restoring, i calculate that it's a moment of transition from my archive.dat to archive0001.dat and that means 2 options
